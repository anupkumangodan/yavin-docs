Yavin UI browser support
-------------------------------------------------
Yavin UI is an HTML-based browser application that is supported on the 3 recent versions of the following browsers:
-   ***Chrome***
-   ***Firefox***
-   ***Safari***

Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------
Before you can use Yavin to **visualize and analyze data**, you need to define your **semantic model** and database configuration in Elide. 

### Data source dialects
Elide analytic APIs **generate SQL queries** against your target database(s). Elide must be **configured with a Dialect** to correctly generate native SQL that matches the database grammar. Elide supports the following dialects by default:

* H2
* Hive
* Presto
* MySQL

More information on dialects and how to use them can be found [here](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#dialects). 

Semantic Models
------------------------------------------
A ***semantic model*** is the view of the data you want your users to understand.   It is typically non-relational (for simplicity) and consists of concepts like tables, measures, and dimensions.  End users refer to these concepts by name only (they are not expected to derive formulas or know about the physical storage or serialization of data).

A ***virtual semantic layer*** maps a semantic model to columns and tables in a physical database.  Yavin leverages Elide's virtual semantic layer which accomplishes this mapping through a HJSON configuration language.  [HJSON](https://hjson.github.io/) is a human friendly adaptation of JSON that allows comments and a relaxed syntax among other features.  Elide's virtual semantic layer includes the following information:
    - The defintions of tables, measures, and dimensions you want to expose to the end user.
    - Metadata like descriptions, categories, and tags that better describe and label the semantic model.
    - For every table, measure, and dimension, a SQL fragment that maps it to the physical data.  These fragements are used by elide to generate native SQL queries against the target database.

More information on Elide's analytic query support and virtual semantic layer can be found [here](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#overview).

### Writing your first semantic model

Elide provides its own [guide](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/01-start.html) for getting started that includes setting up a simle semantic model.  The following sections will illustrate how Yavin is configured to explore [Netflix movie and TV show titles](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows).

#### Connections, Tables, Dimensions, Measures and Joins
When running locally, Yavin will leverage the H2 in-memory database.  The [connection configuration][demo-connection] looks like:

```
{
  dbconfigs: [
    {
      __comment1: "We created the connection for the demo using H2 connection."
      name: DemoConnection
      url: jdbc:h2:mem:DemoDB;  DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;  INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'classpath:create-demo-data.sql'
      driver: org.h2.Driver
      user: guest
      dialect: H2
    }
  ]
}

```

Yavin's demo data includes a single table in its [semantic model][demo-table] NetflixTitles:   


```
{
  tables: [
    {
      # The API name
      name:  NetflixTitles

      # The name presented in the UI
      friendlyName: Netflix Titles

      # The physical table where the data lives.
      table: netflix_titles

      # The database to run queries against
      dbConnectionName: DemoConnection

      # The list of dimensions
      dimensions: [
        {
          # The API name of the dimension.

          definition: "sum(cast (case when {{duration}} like '% Seasons' then REPLACE({{duration}}, ' Seasons', '') else '0' end AS INT))"
        }
        {
          name: movie_duration
          friendlyName: Duration (in mins)
          category: Stats
          type: INTEGER
          definition: "sum(cast (case when {{duration}} like '% min' then REPLACE({{duration}}, ' min', '') else '0' end AS INT))"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: The Netflix demo data only sourced from a single physical table.  More complex data models may source from multiple physical tables and require joins at query time.  More information about joins can be found [here](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#joins).

Yavin Detailed Installation Guide
-----------------------------------------------
Here are the complete steps for installing and setting up **Yavin** with **your data-source** and your **semantic models**:
-  ***Installation***: The ‚Äú<a href="">Quick Start Guide</a>‚Äù walks you through the **steps to setup Yavin** on your system with a built in "*Netflix and TV Shows*" data.
-  Upon installation (Step 1) you will have the **Yavin** repo on your local machine: <a href="https://github.com/yahoo/navi" >https://github.com/yahoo/navi/</a>.
-  Your repo will include the following key subdirectories:

|      Path                      |  Purpose                       |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| ```navi/scripts```  | The published script of Yavin        |
| ```navi/Packages/webservice/app/src/main/resources/ ```  | Your sample data can reside here       |
| ```navi/Packages/webservice/app/src/main/resources/ ``` | Your SQL queries can reside here          |
| ```navi/Packages/webservice/app/src/main/resources/demo-configs/db/sql``` | Your dialect connection can reside here        |
| ```navi/Packages/webservice/app/src/main/resources/demo-configs/models/tables```  | Your semantic models can reside here       |
{:.table}
1.  üõë ¬†STOP, **If your purpose is check how Yavin works using the demo app provided (Without adding any new data sources or semantic models). Then, you should be all set to Jump to step 10.**
2.  Select the correct ‚ÄúData Dialect‚Äù. More information on data dialects can be found here: <a href="https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#dialects" >https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#dialects</a>.
3.  You must set both the ‚Äúenable analytic queries‚Äù and the ‚ÄúHjson configuration‚Äù feature flags. Reference: <a href="https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#feature-flags" >https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#feature-flags</a>. ¬†
4.  Configure the files layout: Analytic model configuration can either be specified through JVM classes decorated with Elide annotations or Hjson configuration files. <a href="https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#file-layout" >https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#file-layout</a>.Path: ¬†../navi/Packages/
5.  Set the data source configuration for the Data Source(s) you will be using: <a href="https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#data-source-configuration" >https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#data-source-configuration</a>. Path on where your data source connection can reside: ../navi/Packages/webservice/app/src/main/resources/demo-configs/db/sql/
6.  Model your data. Your model may be mapped to one or more physical databases, tables, and columns¬†and need not be a ‚Äúone to one‚Äù mirror of the source semantic models. More details on this step can be found at: <a href="https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#model-configuration" >https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#model-configuration</a>. Path on where your semantic models can reside:¬†../navi/Packages/webservice/app/src/main/resources/demo-configs/models/tables
7.  Decide what roles users will need and then configure your security model as per these instructions: <a href="https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#security-configuration" >https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#security-configuration</a>. ¬†
8.  To avoid having to repeat the same configuration block information multiple times, all Hjson files (table, security, and data source) support a variable substitution feature that allows a JSON structure to be associated to a variable name, and then that variable to be used in configuration files. Details can be found at:<a href="https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#variable-substitution" >https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/04-analytics.html#variable-substitution</a>¬†
9.  Before proceeding further, you should validate all of your configuration files. All of the Hjson configuration files are validated by a JSON schema. To validate you configuration, run the following command line:
10. To run Yavin, execute the following command: ```cd packages/webservice && ./gradlew```

‚è±Within minutes, you will be able to launch Yavin on your local browser connection to the ‚ÄúNetflix movies and TV shows data source‚Äù, by launching the ¬†following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>
