- title: Who We Are?
  description: Over the course of the last 5 years, the Data organization at Verizon Media Group has built several data applications to provide insights into various data sets. While each of these applications are unique, several patterns across these systems have been identified. Typically, these systems contain a query engine, a set of web services, and a set of UI flows to manage and explore data sets. This led to the birth of Yavin, a data application platform.
